# Audio-Reactive Visuals in Three.js

Learn how to create immersive audio-reactive visuals using Three.js, inspired by ARKx's work for Coala Music's website.

## Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive guide on creating dynamic and visually stunning audio-reactive visuals using the popular JavaScript library Three.js. By following this tutorial, you'll gain insights into integrating music data from the Spotify API to create synchronized visualizations that respond to the beat and rhythm of the music.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile for Development**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## How to Use

1. **Start the Development Server**:
    - Run `npm run dev` to compile the code and start a local development server.
    - Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Explore the Visuals**:
    - Interact with the audio-reactive visuals rendered in the browser.
    - Observe how the visuals dynamically respond to the music's beat and rhythm.

## Technology Stack

- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for creating and manipulating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Spotify API**: Utilized for fetching music data, including track information and audio analysis such as tempo, beats, and segments.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Applied for animating elements and creating smooth transitions between visual states.
- **WebGL Noise**: Used to generate procedural noise textures, adding complexity and realism to the visuals.
- **web-audio-beat-detector**: A library for detecting beats and analyzing audio features in real-time, essential for synchronizing the visuals with the music.

## Credits

- **Coala Music Website by ARKx**: Inspiration for the audio-reactive visualizations.
- **Three.js Community**: Resources, tutorials, and community support for learning and using Three.js effectively.
- **Spotify API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for integrating Spotify's music data and audio analysis features into web applications.
